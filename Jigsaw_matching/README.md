### Matching Data Generation

This folder is adapted from the [Jigsaw](https://github.com/Jiaxin-Lu/Jigsaw) codebase. Please follow Jigsaw instructions to set up the environment and download the required checkpoints.

We just do the small modifications for the code. The matching data generation function is in the `model/modules/matching_base_model.py`

By simply run their `eval.sh` you can get the matching data.
